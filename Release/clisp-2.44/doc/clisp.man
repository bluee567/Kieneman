[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       Invokes the [1mCommon Lisp[22m[1] interpreter and compiler.
       When called without arguments, executes the
       [4mread-eval-print[24m [4mloop[24m[2], in which expressions are in
       turn [1mREAD[22m[3] from the standard input, [1mEVAL[22m[4]uated by
       the lisp interpreter, and their results are [1mPRINT[22m[5]ed
       to the standard output. Invoked with [1m-c[22m, compiles the
       specified lisp files to a platform-independent bytecode
       which can be executed more efficiently.

[1mOPTIONS[0m
       [1m-h[0m
       [1m--help[0m
           Displays a help message on how to invoke [1mCLISP[22m[6].

       [1m--version[0m
           Displays the [1mCLISP[22m[6] version number, as given by
           the function [1mLISP-IMPLEMENTATION-VERSION[22m[7], the
           value of the variable [4m*FEATURES*[24m, as well some other
           information.

       [1m--license[0m
           Displays a summary of the licensing information, the
           [4mGNU[24m[8] [4mGPL[24m[9].

       [1m-help-image[0m
           Displays information about the memory image being
           invoked: whether is it suitable for scripting as
           well as the [1m:DOCUMENTATION [22msupplied to
           [1mEXT:SAVEINITMEM[22m.

       [1m-B [4m[22mlisp-lib-dir[0m
           Specifies the installation directory. This is the
           directory containing the linking sets and other data
           files. This option is normally not necessary,
           because the installation directory is already
           built-in into the [1mclisp [22mexecutable. Directory
           [4mlisp-lib-dir[24m can be changed dynamically using the
           [4mSYMBOL-MACRO[24m[10] [4m*LIB-DIRECTORY*[24m.

       [1m-K [4m[22mlinking-set[0m
           Specifies the linking set to be run. This is a
           directory (relative to the [4mlisp-lib-dir[24m) containing
           at least a main executable (runtime) and an initial
           memory image. Possible values are

           [1mbase[0m
               the core [1mCLISP[22m[6]

           [1mfull[0m
               core plus all the modules with which this
               installation was built, see Section 32.2,
               "External Modules".

           The default is [1mbase[22m.

       [1m-M [4m[22mmem-file[0m
           Specifies the initial memory image. This must be a
           memory dump produced by the [1mEXT:SAVEINITMEM [22mfunction
           by this [1mclisp [22mruntime.

       [1m-m [4m[22mmemory-size[0m
           Sets the amount of memory [1mCLISP[22m[6] tries to grab on
           startup. The amount may be given as

           [4mnnnnnnn[0m
               measured in bytes

           [4mnnnn[24m[1mK[0m
           [4mnnnn[24m[1mKB[0m
               measured in kilobytes

           [4mn[24m[1mM[0m
           [4mn[24m[1mMB[0m
               measured in megabytes

           The default is 3 megabytes.  The argument is
           constrained above 100 KB.

           This version of [1mCLISP[22m[6] is not likely to actually
           use the entire [4mmemory-size[24m since garbage-collection
           will periodically reduce the amount of used memory.
           It is therefore common to specify 10 MB even if only
           2 MB are going to be used.

       [1m-L [4m[22mlanguage[0m
           Specifies the language [1mCLISP[22m[6] uses to communicate
           with the user. This may be one of [1menglish[22m, [1mgerman[22m,
           [1mfrench[22m, [1mspanish[22m, [1mdutch[22m, [1mrussian[22m, [1mdanish[22m. Other
           languages may be specified through the [4menvironment[0m
           [4mvariable[24m[12] [1mLANG[22m, provided the corresponding
           message catalog is installed.  The language may be
           changed dynamically using the [4mSYMBOL-MACRO[24m[10]
           [4mCUSTOM:*CURRENT-LANGUAGE*[24m.

       [1m-N [4m[22mlocale-dir[0m
           Specifies the base directory of locale files.
           [1mCLISP[22m[6] will search its message catalogs in
           [4mlocale-dir/language/LC_MESSAGES/clisp.mo[24m. This
           directory may be changed dynamically using the
           [4mSYMBOL-MACRO[24m[10] [4mCUSTOM:*CURRENT-LANGUAGE*[24m.

       [1m-E[4m[22mdomain[24m [4mencoding[0m
           Specifies the encoding used for the given domain,
           overriding the default which depends on the
           [4menvironment[24m [4mvariable[24m[12]s [1mLC_ALL[22m, [1mLC_CTYPE[22m, [1mLANG[22m.
           [4mdomain[24m can be

           [1mfile[0m
               affecting [4mCUSTOM:*DEFAULT-FILE-ENCODING*[0m

           [1mpathname[0m
               affecting [4mCUSTOM:*PATHNAME-ENCODING*[0m

           [4mblank[0m
               affecting all of the above.


           Warning
           Note that the values of these [4mSYMBOL-MACRO[24m[10]s that
           have been saved in a memory image are ignored: these
           [4mSYMBOL-MACRO[24m[10]s are reset based on the OS
           environment [1mafter [22mthe memory image is loaded. You
           have to use the RC file, [4mCUSTOM:*INIT-HOOKS*[24m or init
           function to set them on startup, but it is best to
           set the aforementioned [4menvironment[24m [4mvariable[24m[12]s
           appropriately for consistency with other programs.
           See Section 31.1, "Customizing CLISP Process
           Initialization and Termination".

           as per [ANSI CL standard]. The first [1m-q [22mremoves the
           banner and the good-bye message, the second sets
           variables [4m*LOAD-VERBOSE*[24m[13], [4m*COMPILE-VERBOSE*[24m[14]
           and [4mCUSTOM:*SAVEINITMEM-VERBOSE*[24m to [1mNIL[22m[16]. The

           [1mCLISP[22m[6] under [4mEmacs[24m[23] using [4mSLIME[24m[24], [4mILISP[24m[25]
           et al). With this option, [1mCLISP[22m[6] interacts in a
           way that [4mEmacs[24m[23] can deal with:

           +o   unnecessary prompts are not suppressed.

           +o   The [4mGNU[24m[8] [4mreadline[24m[26] library treats TAB (see
               TAB key) as a normal self-inserting character
               (see Q: A.4.5).

       [1m-ansi[0m
           Comply with the [ANSI CL standard] specification
           even where [1mCLISP[22m[6] has been traditionally different
           by setting the [4mSYMBOL-MACRO[24m[10] [4mCUSTOM:*ANSI*[24m to
           [1mT[22m[15].

       [1m-traditional[0m
           Traditional: reverses the residual effects of [1m-ansi[0m
           in the saved memory image.

       [1m-modern[0m
           Provides a modern view of symbols: at startup the
           [4m*PACKAGE*[24m[27] variable will be set to the
           "CS-COMMON-LISP-USER" package, and the
           [4m*PRINT-CASE*[24m[28] will be set to [1m:DOWNCASE[22m. This has
           the effect that symbol lookup is case-sensitive
           (except for keywords and old-style packages) and
           that keywords and uninterned symbols are printed
           with lower-case preferrence. See Section 11.4,
           "Package Case-Sensitivity".

       [1m-p [4m[22mpackage[0m
           At startup the value of the variable [4m*PACKAGE*[24m[27]
           will be set to the package named [4mpackage[24m. The
           default is the value of [4m*PACKAGE*[24m[27] when the image
           was saved, normally [4m"COMMON-LISP-USER"[24m[29].

       [1m-C[0m
           Compile when loading: at startup the value of the
           variable [4mCUSTOM:*LOAD-COMPILING*[24m will be set to
           [1mT[22m[15]. Code being [1mLOAD[22m[30]ed will then be
           [1mCOMPILE[22m[31]d on the fly. This results in slower
           loading, but faster execution.

       [1m-norc[0m
           Normally [1mCLISP[22m[6] loads the user [4m"run[24m [4mcontrol"[0m
           [4m(RC)[24m[32] file on startup (this happens [1mafter [22mthe [1m-C[0m
           option is processed). The file loaded is
           [4m.clisprc.lisp[24m or [4m.clisprc.fas[24m in the home directory
           [1mUSER-HOMEDIR-PATHNAME[22m[33], whichever is newer. This
           option, [1m-norc[22m, prevents loading of the RC file.

       [1m-i [4m[22minit-file[0m
           Specifies initialization files to be [1mLOAD[22m[30]ed at
           startup. These should be lisp files (source or
           compiled). Several [1m-i [22moptions can be given; all the
           specified files will be loaded in order.

       [1m-c [4m[22mlisp-file[0m
           Compiles the specified [4mlisp-file[24ms to bytecode
           ([4m*.fas[24m). The compiled files can then be [1mLOAD[22m[30]ed
           instead of the sources to gain efficiency.

       [1m-o [4m[22moutputfile[0m
           Specifies the output file or directory for the
           compilation of the last specified [4mlisp-file[24m.

       [1m-l[0m
           Produce a bytecode [1mDISASSEMBLE[22m[34] listing ([4m*.lis[24m)
           of the files being compiled. Useful only for
           debugging. See Section 24.1.1, "Function COMPILE-
           FILE" for details.

       [1m-x [4m[22mexpressions[0m
           Executes a series of arbitrary expressions instead
           of a [4mread-eval-print[24m [4mloop[24m[2]. The values of the
           expressions will be output to [4m*STANDARD-OUTPUT*[24m[35].
           Due to the argument processing done by the shell,
           the [4mexpressions[24m must be enclosed in double quotes,
           and double quotes and backslashes must be escaped
           with backslashes.

       [4mlisp-file[24m [ [4margument[24m ... ]
           Loads and executes a [4mlisp-file[24m, as described in
           Script execution. There will be no [4mread-eval-print[0m
           [4mloop[24m[2]. Before [4mlisp-file[24m is loaded, the variable
           [4mEXT:*ARGS*[24m will be bound to a list of strings,

       [1mCLISP_LANGUAGE[0m
           specifies the language [1mCLISP[22m[6] uses to communicate
           with the user. The legal values are identical to
           those of the [1m-L [22moption which can be used to override

[1mBUGS[0m
       When you encounter a bug in [1mCLISP[22m[6] or in its
       documentation (this manual page or CLISP impnotes),
       please report it to the [1mCLISP[22m[6] [4mSourceForge[24m [4mbug[0m
       [4mtracker[24m[49].

       [4mBefore[24m submitting a bug report, please take the
       following basic steps to make the report more useful:

        1.  Please do a clean build (remove your build
           directory and build [1mCLISP[22m[6] with [1m./configure[0m
           [1m--build build [22mor at least do a [1mmake distclean [22mbefore
           [1mmake[22m).

        2.  If you are reporting a "hard crash" (segmentation
           fault, bus error, core dump etc), please do
           [1m./configure --with-debug --build build-g ; cd[0m
           [1mbuild-g; gdb lisp.run[22m, then load the appropriate
           linking set by either [1mbase [22mor [1mfull gdb[22m[50] command,
           and report the backtrace (see also Q: A.1.1.10).

        3.  If you are using pre-built binaries and experience
           a hard crash, the problem is likely to be in the
           incompatibilities between the platform on which the
           binary was built and yours; please try compiling the
           sources and report the problem if it persists.

       When submitting a bug report, please specify the
       following information:

        1.  What is your platform ([1muname -a [22mon a [1mUNIX[22m[41]
           system)? Compiler version?  [4mGNU[24m[8] [4mlibc[24m[51] version
           (on [4mGNU[24m[8]/[4mLinux[24m[52])?

        2.  Where did you get the sources or binaries? When?
           (Absolute dates - like "2006-01-17" - are preferred
           over the relative ones - like "2 days ago").

        3.  How did you build [1mCLISP[22m[6]? (What command, options
           &c.)

        4.  What is the output of [1mclisp --version[22m?

        5.  Please supply the full output (copy and paste) of
           all the error messages, as well as detailed
           instructions on how to reproduce them.

[1mPROJECTS[0m
       +o   Enhance the compiler so that it can inline local
           functions.

       +o   Add Multi-Threading capabilities, via OS threads.
